# How to add a room with a conference to your site using iFrame

You can broadcast a conference in your room at another website. To do this just add an `iFrame` element with specified attributes to the HTML code of your webpage.

**Note**. Using HTTPS should be configured in your website settings.

Example of iFrame code:

```{code-block} html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Some title</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <p>This is the iFrame block with broadcast</p>
  <iframe
    src="https://moodhood.online/room/<room_id>?
    participantName=JohnSmith&refreshToken=someTokenHere"
    id="userplayer"
    frameborder="0"
    width="880px"
    height="595px"
    allow="camera;microphone;fullscreen;accelerometer;autoplay;clipboard-write;encrypted-media;display-capture;gyroscope;picture-in-picture;" allowusermedia>
  </iframe>  
 </body>
</html>
```

The `iFrame` element has the following attributes:

* **src** - the URL with room id or alias (see. [Creating a room](room-create)) to access the room. The URL can have some parameters going after the “?” symbol. These are `participantName` and `refreshToken` of a user for silent authorization.
* **id** - deprecated attribute for iFrame element, left for compatibility with earlier browser versions, the value can be any one.
* **frameborder** - border width around the frame (left it 0).
* **width/height** - width and height of a frame to display it on a webpage.
* **allow** - allowed functions and permissions for the room listed by “;”. For example, the following permissions can turned on/off:
   * *camera* - using camera is allowed;
   * *microphone* - using microphone is allowed;
   * *fullscreen* - full screen mode is allowed;
   * *accelerometer* - using accelerometer is enabled (for mobile devices);
   * *autoplay* - autoplay is enabled; 
   * *clipboard-write* - using clipboard to copy data is allowed;
   * *encrypted-media* - using *Encrypted Media Extension API* is enabled, that allows to manage media content playing on a webpage;
   * *display-capture* - capturing the screen during the broadcast is allowed;
   * *gyroscope* - using gyroscope is enabled;
   * *picture-in-picture* - picture-in-picture mode is allowed;
   * *allowusermedia* - a special permission for users to use their camera and microphone.

Adding a `none` keyword after `allow` for any permission means turning off this function. For example, *allow = camera \`none\`* means that using a camera is not allowed.
